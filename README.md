# DataQuest Project 12 Finding Markets to Advertise in:  

This is the twelfth project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. The goal of this project is to find the two most promising markets to advertise in when starting a new website centered around teaching web and mobile development. For this reason a large survey conducted by FreeDataCamp on new sign-ups to their website was analyzed. The main learning goal of the project was to use statistical methods to make predictions.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the Jupyter notebook as well as the `CSV` file containing the raw data of the survey.

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`  and `matplotlib` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
